+ Boilerplate -> The codes appear automatically when you create the html file

ENTITIES
+ Like there are symbols we shouldn't use them as we write the hmtl code like < or >, so to write thme symbols we are going to use other words to replace them which we call them entities.And these symbols are called "reserved symbols" and also the entity codes end with semicolon;
