WARNINGS
- I messed up one of te buttons while trying to do the sign in (FIXED)
- He changed some stufss while rendering the product pages stuff (src: min 1:20:00) the 8th video (FIXED)
- GET_CART_FAILURE is not available in the (src: cart/ActionType) (FIXED)
- Product reducer I think there is something wrong while dealing with failure thing
- Latency on adding the item to the cart


TODOS
- Define the paths in mainCarouselData

TOLEARNS
- How does variant, component works (source footer)
- How to handle form (source -> DeliveryAddresForm.jsx)
- REDUX
- decodeURIComponent(location.search)
- Why taking an "event" parameter on a product method for handling pagination


NEW IDEAS
- Using Relative containers for next and prev button 

REACT ALICE CAROUSEL
- onSlideChanged -> first changes the state then the carousel (not so responsive but no bugs)
- onSlideChange -> first changes the carousel then the state (makes the browser responsive but with bugs) 

SHORTCUTS
- CTRL + I -> for auto import or fix the line automatically
- CTRL + SPACE -> for auto import or fix the line automatically

LEARNED
- useNavigate() -> tells where to go after an event happened by giving the url paht (src. RegisterForm.jsx -)
- useLocation() -> finds the current url and do things accordingly by using `pahtname` attribute (src. Authmodal.jsx - 30)
- in CustomRouter.jsx is where you define the web urls and inside page urls such as /login and /register but they are all in Homepage.jsx
