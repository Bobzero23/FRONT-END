ARRAYS
+ push -> method to add element to thes to array (it returns the size of an array)
Note: Not like java you can put different data types to this array
+ pop -> removing the last element of the array and returns it.
+ shift
+ unshift
+ concat
+ reverse
+ slice(?start, ?end)
Note: is not necessary to put both 'start' and 'end', and the '?' means optional but if you don't put anything
it will return the copy of that array, it always includes the start but not the end.
+ splice(start, howManyToDelete, 'smthToAdd') -> to put in betwween (original destructive)
+ sort -> converting every element of arrya to its UTF-16 code value and sort accordingly
Note: the sorting method it doesn't work like the other programming languages
Note: It's normal to use 'const' because we dont change the reference we just change the context.
Note: arrays can also arrays inside and also objects

OBJECTS 
+ property = key : value
Note: we gonna need to use the key to get our value back
